            <h1>“Metaethics” means “about ethics”.</h1>
            <p>Metaethics tries to figure out, why we consider some actions good and others evil. – Hi, I am Dushan Wegner, let me help you know good and evil, in 10 simple steps!</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Everyone is part of structures, e.g. the family, a company, a society, but also ways of thinking or of course their own body.</li>
            <li>Some structures <em>are</em> relevant (e.g. the family for a baby), others <em>feel</em> very relevant (e.g. an ideology) – sometimes it overlaps, sometimes it doesn’t.</li>
            <li>Some structures do not feel relevant, e.g. because we are not aware of them, but they <em>are</em> very much relevant (e.g. the water supply), other structures <em>feel</em> very relevant, but <em>are</em> not actually relevant (e.g. because they do not exist, like the protagonist of a novel). Congruence of actually relevant and emotionally relevant structures may be a sign of wisdom.</li>
            <li>The relevance of some structure types is innate in most people, e.g. the relevance of the structure “children / preservation-of-the-species”.</li>
            <li>Changes are ethical issues if they strengthen or weaken a structure that is relevant (to us). To strengthen/ weaken a structure means to make its continued existence more probable/ endanger it.</li>
            <li>We call an action “good” when it strengthens a structure that feels relevant to us.</li>
            <li>We call an action “evil” when it weakens a structure that feels relevant to us.</li>
            <li>In order to manipulate people or to persuade them (including yourself), you have to make the structures affected by change feel relevant and/or show the consequences of pending changes to relevant structures.</li>
            <li>In order to know yourself, you have to become aware of which structures both <em>feel</em> and <em>are</em> relevant to you.</li>
            <li>The great ethical truths and universal values ​​can be spelled out like this: "It has been shown that at the end of their days and after careful consideration, many people considered these structures to be maximally relevant and therefore wanted to see them strengthened."</li>
            </ol>
            <hr/>
            <p>I have put forward this explanation of ethics (ergo: this <em>metaethics</em>) in my German book <a href="https://www.dushanwegner.com/buecher/relevante-strukturen/">“Relevante Strukturen”</a>. For traditional explanations of metaethics please see <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
            <p>My main website with German essays is <a href="https://www.dushanwegner.com">dushanwegner.com</a>. </p>
            <p><a href="https://metaethics.org">metaethics.org</a> is hosted by Github Pages (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank">privacy</a>). And yes, I also own <a href="https://metaethics.net">metaethics.net</a> and <a href="https://metaethics.com">metaethics.com</a>. I believe that thinking about the nature of ethics will become important – maybe it already is.</p>
